## main_stem.py

### get_text_overlay()

1. Need to find a way to get PyTesseract to install automatically through a bash file and not have to go through the installation loop
2. Keras_ocr is also a good alternative, will need to check on it later on

### get_overlay_box()

1. Need to find a good way to understand what threshold is good, might need to go a little more DL/CNN route
2. Might need to apply RE to check what the text has to give in totality while also removing the bad reads from the image
